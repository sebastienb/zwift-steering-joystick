# Zwift Steering Joystick
Allows you to steer in Zwift using a joystick and an ESP32.
This is a slighly modified verion of the code by Peter Everett wich uses a potentiometer.
See his verison on: https://sourceforge.net/projects/zwift-steering-esp32/

## The Hardware

Microcontroller: ESP32
Joystick: 5v Arduino Joystick. I'm using one I had laying around from an old arduino kit but any arduino joystick should work.
